## RMarkdown Guides {-}

Learning how to create documents in RMarkdown for the first time can be quite daunting, especially in this module which requires extensive mathematical formulae, plots and code to be included. To help you with this, I have listed a number of very useful online guides that I use myself when creating RMarkdown documents (including these notes). Be aware that some of them contain alot of information so be careful to only read through the relevant sections:

1. [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

2. [R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)

3. [Authoring Books with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)
