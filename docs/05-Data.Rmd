<!-- # Data Analysis -->

<!-- In this session we will discuss how to create data frames (objects similar to matrices which are typically used to store data) manually (explaining how this differs from a matrix), methods of extracting and manipulating data effectively and, finally, use of the `apply()` function(s).  -->

<!-- ## Creating a data frame   -->

<!-- We have already been introduced to the idea of a data frame in the previous sessions through the `mtcars' data set: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- str(mtcars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- However, in general, a data frame is simply an array of data, where each row denotes a separate data point or observation and each column a different variable. Why are these different from matrices in R? -->

<!-- The main difference between a 'matrix' and a 'dataframe' in R is what can be stored within them. We have already stated that a matrix (like a vector) can consist of numerical values OR Boolean values OR character strings. However, what I have not yet mentioned is they cannot be a mixture of these things: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- V1 <- c(1, 2, 3) -->
<!-- str(V1) -->

<!-- V2 <- c("Hello", "Red", "UK") -->
<!-- str(V2) -->

<!-- V3 <- c(T, T, F) -->
<!-- str(V3) -->

<!-- (V <- c(V1, V2, V3))  -->
<!-- str(V) -->

<!-- (M <- matrix(c(V1, V2, V3), nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = FALSE)) -->
<!-- str(M) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- As you can see in the above, since a matrix can only consists of objects of the same type, R has automatically re-assigned the objects to match with one of the object types. Again, this is a perfect example of why you need to be so careful when programming as your code may appear to work but the reality is quite different.   -->

<!-- Data frames on the other hand, allow us to create a matrix like structure but each column may take on a different variable format. This is ideal when working and storing data. Let us look at how to create a data frame using the above vectors V1, V2 and V3: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- data <- data.frame(Numeric = V1, Characters = V2, Boolean = V3) -->
<!-- knitr::kable(data, align = "ccc") -->
<!-- str(data)  -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- What do you notice about the character strings in this data frame? It is important to decide if any 'words' or 'character strings' in your data set are simply words or if they resemble different factors of a given group. In the latter case, you need to tell R this! This is very important when applying a variety of statistical functions to your data. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- data1 <- data.frame(Numeric = V1, Characters = V2, Boolean = V3, stringsAsFactors = F) -->
<!-- str(data1) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- data2 <- data.frame(Numeric = V1, Characters = V2, Boolean = V3, stringsAsFactors = T) -->
<!-- str(data2) -->

<!-- rownames(data1) <- c("Observation 1", "Observation 2", "Observation 3") -->
<!-- knitr::kable(data1, align = "ccc") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Now that we have created our data frame, we can begin to analyse the data in any way we choose! We will discuss a little later on more complex ways in which we may want to do this. For now, let us look at one more example to make sure we understand how data frames are created: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- Height <- rgamma(20, shape = 70, rate = 0.4) # Simulates/generates Gamma Distributed variables -->
<!-- head(Height) -->

<!-- Weight <- rnorm(20, mean = 75, sd = 10)  -->
<!-- head(Weight) -->

<!-- Age <- rpois(20, lambda = 20) # Simulates/generates Poisson Distributed variables -->
<!-- Age -->

<!-- Sex<- ifelse(rbinom(20,1,prob=0.5) == 1, "Male", "Female") # How has this worked? -->

<!-- Data <- data.frame(Height_cm = Height, Weight_Kg = Weight, Age_Years = Age, Sex = Sex, stringsAsFactors = T) -->
<!-- knitr::kable(Data, align = "cccc") -->
<!-- str(Data) -->

<!-- mean(Data$Height_cm) -->
<!-- mean(Data$Height_cm > 170) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Another helpful tool worth mentioning here when analysing data in a data frame is the `table()` function, which counts the frequency of different observations and displays them in a table format: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- table(Data$Age_Years) -->
<!-- table(Data$Age_Years,Data$Sex)  -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Importing data - Excel -->

<!-- In most cases when working with data, the observations will have been collected and stored in another programme which is better built for data collection, e.g. Excel. Fortunately, R can import such data easily and will save the imported values into a data frame type object (known as a tibble) automatically. It is also possible to save it directly as a data frame explicitly if preferred. At this stage, the differences between tibble and a data frame are not important.  -->

<!-- To do this, use the following steps: -->

<!-- 1. Click the `Import Dataset` option within the Environment window (Top right) -->
<!-- 2. Click 'From Excel...' (You may be asked to install some packages here, if so press 'Yes' or 'Okay') -->
<!-- 3. Click `Browse' to enter your files -->
<!-- 4. Choose the Excel file containing the Data  -->
<!-- 5. Edit the Dataset name (if necessary) -->
<!-- 6. Choose which sheet you want to import from the Excel file (if necessary) -->
<!-- 7. Decide if you need to skip any rows due to format -->
<!-- 8. Tick first row as names if appropriate -->
<!-- 9. Press import -->
<!-- 10. Re-save as a data frame (if necessary) -->

<!-- In this example I will import four different data sets (Male and Female Deaths and Population in UK) from the 'UK(Pop&Death).xls' data set and name them 1) `Male_UK_Death`, 2) `Female_UK_Death`, 3) `Male_UK_Pop` and 4) `Female_UK_Pop`, respectively.  -->

<!-- Clearly I cannot show you the above steps explicitly in these notes, but they are the steps that have been used to load the data here. Below is an example of what the corresponding code that is executed looks like when following these steps (you may find that your directory path where you have saved the data is different but that should be it): -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- library(readxl) -->
<!-- Male_UK_Death <- read_excel("UK(Pop&Death).xls", sheet = "UK male deaths") -->
<!-- Female_UK_Death <- read_excel("UK(Pop&Death).xls", sheet = "UK female deaths") -->
<!-- Male_UK_Pop <- read_excel("UK(Pop&Death).xls", sheet = "UK male pop") -->
<!-- Female_UK_Pop <- read_excel("UK(Pop&Death).xls", sheet = "UK female pop") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- **Note: It is also possible to import data from a number of other sources (SPSS, Stata, SAS, .csv files etc.)** -->

<!-- ## Manipulating and analysing data -->

<!-- In many cases, the data set that we have imported may not be exactly how we want it for our analysis. There are a huge number of things that you may want/need to do to your data to tidy it up or 'clean' the data as it is commonly known. For example, deal with missing data, extract unimportant rows/columns, delete outliers, combine data sets etc.  -->

<!-- As an example, let us have a little look at the data sets we created: -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=F} -->
<!-- library(DT) -->
<!-- datatable(Male_UK_Death, options = list(scrollX = TRUE)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We would like to remove the last two rows of this data set as they don't contain 'raw' data. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- Male_UK_Death_New <- Male_UK_Death[-c(107, 108),] -->
<!-- datatable(Male_UK_Death_New, options=list(scrollX = TRUE)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Then, in a similar way, we can do the same with the rest of the data sets as they have same problem  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- Female_UK_Death_New <- Female_UK_Death[-c(107, 108),]  -->
<!-- Male_UK_Pop_New <- Male_UK_Death[-c(107, 108),] -->
<!-- Female_UK_Pop_New <- Female_UK_Pop[-c(107, 108),] -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We have now tidied up our data to be in a format more beneficial to us and we could start to analyse these individually, i.e. Create plots, calculate statistics, fit statistical models etc. For example: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- Aux <- Male_UK_Death_New[-106,] -->
<!-- summary(lm(Aux$Age ~ Aux$`1961`)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- However, what if we were not interested in the individual data sets separated by sex and only cared about the overall deaths and population. That is, we want to combine the data sets. In this case, we need to create a new data frame with the relevant data.  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- Overall_Deaths <- data.frame(Male_UK_Death_New$Age, Male_UK_Death_New[,-1] + Female_UK_Death_New[,-1]) -->
<!-- colnames(Overall_Deaths) <- colnames(Male_UK_Death_New) -->
<!-- datatable(Overall_Deaths, options=list(scrollX=TRUE)) -->

<!-- Overall_Pop <- data.frame(Male_UK_Pop_New$Age, Male_UK_Pop_New[,-1]+Female_UK_Pop_New[,-1]) -->
<!-- colnames(Overall_Pop) <- colnames(Male_UK_Pop_New) -->
<!-- datatable(Overall_Pop, options=list(scrollX=TRUE)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- :::{.exercise} -->
<!-- Use these two data sets to create a data frame consisting of the mortality rates for the UK population over each year. That is, the probability of dying in a given year based on your age? -->
<!-- ::: -->

<!-- <details> -->
<!-- <summary>**Solution**</summary> -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- Mortality <- data.frame(Male_UK_Death_New$Age, round(Overall_Deaths[,-1]/Overall_Pop[,-1], digits = 5)) -->
<!-- colnames(Mortality) <- colnames(Male_UK_Pop_New) -->
<!-- head(Mortality) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- **Note - We could have done this for the individual sex data sets to obtain a more accurate estimate of mortality based on sex.** -->
<!-- </details> -->

<!-- Before we carry on, let us actually have a look at this data visually now that we have created it: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- plot(0:105, Overall_Pop$`1961`, type = "l", main = "UK Population by Age 1961", xlab = "Age", ylab = "Population") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- :::{.exercise} -->
<!-- As actuaries, you need to be able to critically analyse data, not just use it. What do you think is the reason for these spikes and falls in the data? -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- plot(0:105, Overall_Pop$`1961`, type = "l", main = "UK Population by Age 1961", xlab = "Age", ylab = "Population") -->
<!-- abline(v = 14, col = "red", lty = 2) -->
<!-- abline(v = 40, col = "red", lty = 2) -->
<!-- abline(v = 43, col = "blue", lty = 2) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ::: -->

<!-- <details> -->
<!-- <summary>**Solution**</summary> -->
<!-- The simple answer is most likely World War 2. The initial spike in the population at around the age of 14/15 due to the baby boom immediately after the end of the war in 1947, this would result in a surge of 14/15 year olds in 1961. The same thing ocurred after World War 1, which is the likely cause of the second spike at around age 41/42. The sudden drop or fall just after this at around the 43/44 year mark is most likely due to the fact that individuals aged roughly 43/44 in 1961 would have been aged roughly 23/24 at the start of World War 2 in 1942, the prime age for fighting soldiers.  -->

<!-- :::{.exercise} -->
<!-- Why would these spikes be of such importance to us as actuaries? -->

<!-- lines(0:105, Overall_Pop$`2013`, type = "l", col= "blue") -->
<!-- lines(0:105, Mortality$`2017`, type = "l", col = "green") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- These spikes in the different ages will drift with time and eventually cause spikes in the population at retirement age. This is extremely important for pension actuaries when modelling and predicting pension plans and beneift payments.  -->

<!-- for(i in 3:(ncol(Mortality)-2)){ -->
<!--   lines(0:105, Mortality[,i], type = "l", col = i) -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- </details> -->

<!-- ## Conditional extraction -->

<!-- There may be circumstances where you want to consider some analysis of a data set, but you may only be interested in particular observations that satisfy certain conditions. For example, assume we wanted to price a pension annuity (regular payments until death), then we would only be interested in the Mortality rates of pensioners (65+). We can extract this information using the conditional arguments we have seen in previous sessions. However, before we can do this, we have to amend the Age values in the Mortality data set to be numerical/integer values rather than characters: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- class(Mortality$Age) -->
<!-- Mortality$Age <- 0:105 -->
<!-- class(Mortality$Age) -->

<!-- Mort_pension <- Mortality[Mortality$Age >= 65, ]  -->
<!-- datatable(Mort_pension, options=list(scrollX=TRUE)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- How does this work? This is a combination of conditional statements and extraction. In short, the conditional statement creates a vector of `TRUE`/`FALSE` values which are then used in the matrix type extraction technique we discussed in previous weeks. The result is that R will only extract the row(column) numbers corresponding to `TRUE` values. This is known as 'conditional extraction'. -->


<!-- Moreover, due to changes in technology and the NHS, we may decide that mortality rates pre-2000 are not valid enough to be used in our calculations, so we might only want to consider post-2000 values. Can we do this in a similar way? In general you will not be able to  extract certain columns using conditional arguments since they represent different variables. However, you can do this by inspection, using matrix extraction and the `which()` function: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- which(colnames(Mortality) == "2000") -->

<!-- Mort_pension_2000 <- Mort_pension[,c(1,41:ncol(Mort_pension))] -->
<!-- datatable(Mort_pension_2000, options=list(scrollX=TRUE)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In general, it is possible to use the conditional argument format to extract rows from data sets, as long as you are conditioning on elements/variables within the data rather than column names. To see this, let us briefly revisit the mtcars data set from the previous sessions -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- datatable(mtcars, options=list(scrollX=TRUE)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Assume that you only want to deal with cars that have 6 or 8 cylinders: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- data <- mtcars[mtcars$cyl >= 6, ] -->
<!-- datatable(data, options=list(scrollX=TRUE)) -->

<!-- data1 <- mtcars[mtcars$cyl >= 6 & mtcars$hp > 100, ] -->
<!-- datatable(data1, options=list(scrollX=TRUE)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Adding data  -->

<!-- As well as extracting data from data frame, it is also possible to add new data to an existing data frame. That is, add a new observation (row) or even add a new variable (column) which is possibly even calculated using the rest of the data. There are a number of ways to add a new row to a dataframe but I find the easiest is to use something similar to row extraction but for an undefined row (non-existent row). Let us first create a data frame: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- new_data <- data.frame(A = c(1,2,3), B = c("Pass", "Fail", "Pass"), C = c("M", "M", "F")) -->
<!-- knitr::kable(new_data, align="ccc") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Now, we can add a new row/observation to this existing data frame: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- new_data[nrow(new_data)+1,] <- c(4, "Fail", "M") -->
<!-- knitr::kable(new_data, align="ccc") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- However, this only really works when adding a single row. If you wanted to add another data frame, you can use the rowbind function `rbind()`: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- add_data <- data.frame(A = c(5,6,7), B = c("Pass", "Pass", "Pass"), C = c("F", "M", "F")) -->
<!-- knitr::kable(add_data, align = "ccc") -->

<!-- new_data <- rbind(new_data, add_data) -->
<!-- knitr::kable(new_data, align = "ccc") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- With this in mind, let us revisit the Mortality data set for pensioners post 2000: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- datatable(Mort_pension_2000, options=list(scrollX=TRUE)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- If we want to add a new column/variable, you can do this in a very similar way as for rows. As an example, let us assume we want to add the mean of the mortality rates across years for the different ages. -->

<!-- :::{.exercise}  -->
<!-- Can you create a vector of the mean mortality rates for each age using loops? -->
<!-- ::: -->

<!-- <details> -->
<!-- <summary>**Solution**</summary> -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- mean_mort <- c() -->
<!-- for(i in 1:nrow(Mort_pension_2000)){ -->
<!--   mean <- round(mean(as.numeric(Mort_pension_2000[i,-1])), digits = 5) -->
<!--   mean_mort <- c(mean_mort, mean) -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- mean_mort -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- </details> -->

<!-- Now that we have calculated the value, let us add it to the data. This can be done using any of the following methods: -->

<!-- **Method 1** -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- Mort_pension_2000[,ncol(Mort_pension_2000)+1] <- mean_mort -->
<!-- colnames(Mort_pension_2000)[ncol(Mort_pension_2000)] <- c("Mean") -->
<!-- datatable(Mort_pension_2000, options=list(scrollX=TRUE)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- **Method 2** -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- Mort_pension_2000 <- Mort_pension_2000[,-ncol(Mort_pension_2000)] # This just removes the last column we added -->

<!-- Mort1 <- cbind(Mort_pension_2000, mean_mort) -->
<!-- colnames(Mort1)[ncol(Mort1)] <- c("Mean") -->
<!-- datatable(Mort1, options=list(scrollX=TRUE)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- **Method 3** -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- Mort2 <- data.frame(Mort_pension_2000, mean_mort) -->
<!-- colnames(Mort2) <- c(colnames(Mort_pension_2000), "Mean") -->
<!-- datatable(Mort2, options=list(scrollX=TRUE)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## The `apply` family -->

<!-- The final tool I want to talk about in this R module is the family of functions known as the `apply()` functions. Put simply, the `apply()` function, along with the its counterparts `lapply()`, `sapply()` and `vapply()` allow us to 'apply' a particular function on each row and/or column of a data frame (and other objects) without using loops.  -->

<!-- The `apply()` function is basically a quicker and more convenient version of a `for()` loop and should always be considered first before loops as they are easier to write, read and are a lot quicker to execute which makes a huge difference when working with larger data sets.  -->

<!-- The `apply()` function takes 3 main inputs (it can take more and we will discuss this soon). The first is the object you want to 'apply' the function to, in our case today a data frame. The second is either of the following: `1`, `2`, or `c(1,2)` where `1` indicates you want the function to be applied to the rows of the object,`2` for the columns of the object and `c(1,2)` to individual elements. Finally, the third input is the name of the function we want to apply.  -->

<!-- As an example, let us look at finding the means for each row of the `Mort_pension_2000` data frame as we did before using `for()` loops.  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- apply(Mort_pension_2000[,-1], 1, mean) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Does the output seem a little strange? You should notice that the row names are not the actual ages but the row number the ages were on! Again, be careful. Although, this can be easily rectified: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- rownames(Mort_pension_2000) <- 65:105 -->
<!-- apply(Mort_pension_2000[,-1], 1, mean) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Using this simple execution, we could add the mean column to our original data set using the following lines of code: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- Mort3 <- cbind(Mort_pension_2000, round(apply(Mort_pension_2000[,-1], 1, mean),digits = 5)) -->
<!-- colnames(Mort3)[ncol(Mort3)] <- "Mean" -->
<!-- datatable(Mort3, options=list(scrollX=TRUE)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- :::{.exercise}  -->
<!-- With this in mind, can you now add the standard deviation for each age to the end of Mort3, using the `apply()` function? -->
<!-- ::: -->

<!-- <details> -->
<!-- <summary>**Solution**</summary> -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- Mort3 <- cbind(Mort3, apply(Mort_pension_2000[,-1], 1, sd)) -->
<!-- colnames(Mort3)[ncol(Mort3)] <- "Std. Dev." -->
<!-- head(Mort3) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- </details> -->

<!-- Just so you can see how this works let's look at the same function applied to columns: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- apply(Mort_pension_2000[,-1], 2, mean) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Finally, let us try on the individual elements (obviously we will have to use something other than mean here): -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- apply(Mort_pension_2000, c(1,2), class) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You can use ANY function in the `apply()` command, including those which have multiple inputs - in this case, the additional inputs are just input as additional inputs into the `apply()` function itself - and custom created functions like those we created in the previous week. As a final example, let us create a function and use it within `apply()` on the Mortality data: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- min_max <- function(x, type){ -->
<!--   ordered <- sort(x) -->
<!--   if(type == "min"){ -->
<!--     return (ordered[1]) -->
<!--   } else if (type == "max"){ -->
<!--     return(ordered[length(ordered)]) -->
<!--   } -->
<!-- } -->

<!-- apply(Mort_pension_2000[,-1], 1, min_max, type = "min") -->

<!-- apply(Mort_pension_2000[,-1], 1, min_max, type = "max") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- There are some very subtle differences between `lapply()`, `sapply()` and `vapply()` that I will not go into here but please make sure to work through the DataCamp courses to understand these. For the sake of this course, the apply() function allows us to do what we want sufficiently! Feel free to now have a go at the final set of exercises below: -->

<!-- ## Exercises -->

<!-- 1. A traffic engineer is investigating the consistency and use of public buses in York.

<!-- 8. Using the relative returns calculated in Exercise 7., create a plot which compares the mean relative returns per year for each of the stocks. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- head(format(StockPriceNew$Date, format = "%Y")) # You can see this extracts the Year within the date column (see output). We can use this now within our conditional extraction below -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- sdreturns <- c() -->
<!-- for(i in 1994:2015){ -->
<!--   sd <- apply(StockPriceNew[format(StockPriceNew$Date, format = "%Y") == i, 7:11], 2, sd) -->
<!--   sdreturns <- rbind(sdreturns, sd) -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- rownames(sdreturns) <- 1994:2015 -->
<!-- sdreturns -->
